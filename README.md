# Distance Lines
 Vertices cloud. Each vertex check its distance to other vertices in particle cloud. Vertices make a connection line according to predefined distance value. If there are more than 3 vertices in connection, they will build a triagular mesh. Line and triangle group's opacity also depends on the distance value.
